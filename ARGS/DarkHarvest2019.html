                <h3>The Beginning / 1st Candle</h3>
            <p>So before the Dark Harvest event was in-game we had a little treasure hunt with the Unseen twitter. </p>

                <blockquote><a href="https://twitter.com/dntls_TheUnseen/status/1184157755940061184">ИT БЭΓИNΣ</a></blockquote>
            
            <p>On October 15th these words were uttered by the Unseen Twitter. Translating them give you <b>“It begins”</b>
            Later that night, the Unseen strikes again. The Dauntless Roadmap got an update.
            They added their logo to the Dark Harvest event. That is not all, if you check using a developer tool in your browser you will find this: </p>

            <img src="..\assets\clues\2019\roadmap.png">

            <p>It is a response to the first cipher. When you translate this you get "<b>So it has</b>". <br>
            While all of this was happening the Unseen Twitter changed its cover picture to candles in a cave</p>

            <img src="..\assets\clues\2019\Candles\1.jpg" class="candle">

            <p>These candles started to symbolize the fact that a new clue has been given. So we started looking at twitter waiting for a new candle being lit.</p>
        </section>
            
            <hr>

        <section id="2ndCandle">
                <h3>2nd Candle</h3>

            <p>The Unseen twitter also changed its cover to this photo:</p>

            <img src="..\assets\clues\2019\Candles\2.jpg" class="candle">
            
            <p>And if you look at the left bottom corner, you will notice that there is text.</p>

            <img src="..\assets\clues\2019\2candlecipher.png">

            <p>This cover says:</p>
            
                <blockquote>TㅎЭ ФΩㄹΓΩTTЭN TㅎЭ</blockquote>
            
            <p>When translating you get “<b>The Forgotten The</b>” and then 2 strange symbols. The new symbols were an “A” with a stroke and an “Anger” Symbol. These symbols we wrote of as new letters by we couldn’t figure out what letter. So, we had to let that be for now. We started to look for changes in anything Any piece of code or something. But came up short. Until the moment we figured out another clue. Around 7 pm the same day, we got a change in the Unseen Twitter.</p>
        </section>

            <hr>

        <section id="3rdCandle">
                <h3>3rd Candle</h3>

            <p>The candles in the cover changed. Instead of there being 2 there was 3 lit. This led us to believe that each candle resembles a clue. So, we started looking. A partner stream was scheduled at the same time. So, we went there. On the partner stream of a certain Seabats we found a little piece of Unseen.</p>
            
            <img src="..\assets\clues\2019\Candles\3.jpg" class="candle">

            <img src="..\assets\clues\2019\3candlecipher.png">
            <p>When you went to his stream you would find a cipher again.</p>

                <blockquote>TㅎЭ</blockquote>

            <p>Which translated it means “<b>The</b>”.</p>

            <p>This string of Unseen was like the last one, 2 new symbols. What could they mean? It was here where Roel came up with the theory of them being that as he puts it “These are pieces of a positional puzzle”, his theory was that these new symbols were not letters or words. They were anchors (‡ Ɏ). They were needed to piece the text together. We could not confirm this theory before we had more. So, we waited.</p>
        </section>

            <hr>

        <section id="4thCandle">
                <h3></h3>
            <img src="..\assets\clues\2019\Candles\4.jpg" class="candle">

            <p>Not long after, another change happened with the Twitter.<br>
            A fourth candle had been lit. Meaning a new clue. And sure enough, we found on. Upon logging in you would receive this message:</p>

            <img src="..\assets\clues\2019\ingame notification.png">

            <p>This started to get interesting. When translating the header which says:</p>
                <blockquote>ΣЭЭㅋ . ΣЭЭ- . - ΣЭЭN</blockquote> 
            <p>Which when translated means “<b>Seek . See- . - Seen</b>” Through we thought there was more to the header. Because there was dots and dashes. So when doing Morse translation we found that it gives AA. For most of you that makes no sense, but to all that understand Morse code it means something. When the signal “.-.-“ is given it means that its an “Unknown Station”. This might just be a coinsidence but still felt that it could be included.

            The other part of the text is:</p>

            <blockquote>ㅎЭY ㅏㄹЭ WㅏTCㅎИNΓ (repeating)</blockquote>
            
            <p>Translating this gives you “They are watching” this message repeats itself to make sure we understand. And last but not least there is messages inside the picture.</p>

            <img src="..\assets\clues\2019\Unseen_2019_upon_logging_in.png">

            <p>So, when so look at the picture you will get:</p>
                <blockquote>ㅏㄹЭ ΛWㅏYΣ ΩΠЭN</blockquote> 
            <p>when translated you get this “<b>Are lways open</b>” there seems to be a dot at the end of open and we think that is another anchor symbol. Same with the NT and the lightning in the photo.

                There was also a change to the Roadmap. They decided to change the panel for the Dark Harvest. Then someone figured out that there was a class in the dev tooled called "Konami". For those that don't know the Konami code. It is a throwback to the NES from 1986. The ultimate cheat code. The Konami Code. When inputted on the roadmap. We get a change.</p>

            <img src="..\assets\clues\2019\Unseen_2019_Konami_Code.png">
            
            <p>All the text changes into Unseen. And the Unseen Icon changed. If you inspect the element and take the code, you will get a long string of text. What you see here is BASE64 and if you run this back to a file. You can get an image:</p>

            <img src="..\assets\clues\2019\4candlecipher.png" width="500px" height="300px">

                <blockquote>WЭ ㅎㅏUNT TㅎЭ</blockquote>
            <p>So now when you translate this you get. “<b>We haunt the</b>” and then two new anchors. This just made us more confused. Since have gotten nothing to support our theory or help us in any way.</p>

        <section id="5thCandle">

            <img src="..\assets\clues\2019\Candles\5.jpg" class="candle">
            <p>The fifth candle had been lit and that meant a new clue. And wouldn’t you know it. We found one. Around 3:53 PM PDT we got an article made by GameSpot named “We’re Giving Away 1,000 Timely Arrival Packs For Dauntless”. If you scrolled down you would find:</p>

            <img src="..\assets\clues\2019\5candlecipher.png" width="500px" height="300px">

            <p>We were welcomed by this:</p>

                <blockquote>TㅎЭ UNΣЭЭNx ΣㅎㅏΔΩWЭ</blockquote>

            <p>When run this through a translator we will get: “<b>The Unseen shadowe</b>” Then we get 2 new symbols. But if you look closely you will notice we have seen one before. The anger symbol was found in the candle message. Our theory of having the symbols be anchors grew stronger. We just need that little piece of information to make sure that we were correct.</p>

        </section>

        <section id="6thCandle">

            <img src="..\assets\clues\2019\Candles\6.jpg" class="candle">

            <p>When the 6th candle lighted up. Xanny Phantom, a Dauntless Partner released a video on his youtube channel. A weird mysterious video with a lot of scenes from the Shattered Isles.</p><br>

                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_wa64Biv-1Y?controls=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

            <p>Once we saw this video we instantly knew it was in reverse. We ran it through audio software. Reversed it and it was still wrong. Then we sped it up by 4x and we got a clear message. </p>

                <audio controls>
                    <source src="..\assets\clues\2019\Xanny Audio.wav" type="audio/wav" title="Xanny Phantom Audio">
                    Your browser does not support the audio element.
                </audio>
            
            <p>This led us to believe there was something in the video only visible for a second. So, we when looking and we found it at. It was a message, an Unseen message.</p>

            <p>After I ran this through a video editing software and played around with the lighting, we got something along these lines.</p>

                <blockquote>ㅈUΔΓЭ ФΩㄹ ㅎㅏVЭ ФㅏИΛЭΔ</blockquote>

            <p>3 symbols, one of which we have seen before in the 4th candle. But when translating it reads “<b>Judge for have failed</b>”. Leading to our anchor theory working. We now had two sentences where there was the same symbol. So, meaning 4 ciphers connected now.</p>

            <p>We got it. After blood sweat and tears it finally happened, we got a clue. The Unseen twitter became alive. And sent us this message.</p>

            <p>This message reads</p>

            <p>And it translates to “<b>An old record of when one became three. Through our past, our future becomes clear</b>”. An old record of when one became three. This led us to think of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efA28FmmV4M">console release</a> and it was. On the trailer for the console announcement, we found it in the description.</p>

                <blockquote>ЗЭㄹΩTWΩTWΩΣЭ𑀯ЭNΩNЭЗЭㄹΩЗЭㄹΩNИNЭЗЭㄹΩФΩUㄹTWΩФΩUㄹЗЭㄹΩЭИΓㅎTTWΩФΩUㄹЗЭㄹΩЭИΓㅎTΩNЭФИ𑀯ЭΩNЭTWΩЗЭㄹΩΣЭ𑀯ЭNЗЭㄹΩФИ𑀯ЭTWΩΩNЭЗЭㄹΩΣЭ𑀯ЭNΩNЭΣИXЗЭㄹΩΣЭ𑀯ЭNTWΩФИ𑀯Э</blockquote>

            <p>And to save you all the hassle of translating this from unseen to English it will just say that they are numbers. In this order. “<b>022710090424082408151207052107160725</b>” this left us baffled for a few minutes until someone suggested that they might be dates. So, we made them to dates. Separating them all into 4 numbers. And this led us to look for patch notes and boy did we find some.

            All the different dates were patch notes, but they were not just from the English patch notes it was also from the other languages.</p>

            <p>All of these words led to a page with some code. First, we had to figure out what the code was and we settled on Base64. So we then translated it. And this was a result.</p>
            <img src="..\assets\clues\2019\15candlecipher.png" width="700px">

            <p>This message reads:</p>
                <blockquote>WΩㄹΛΔ</blockquote>
            <p>And when translated it says “<b>World</b>”.<br>With this message, we finally completed the puzzle. Since now we got the final message.</p>

            <img src="..\assets\clues\2019\Unseen_2019_-_Finale_cipher.png">

            <p>The final version says:</p>
                <blockquote>TㅎЭ ФΩㄹΓΩTTЭN,TㅎЭ ΛΩΣT, TㅎЭ ФΩㄹΣㅏㅋЭN, TㅎЭ VЭNΓЭФUΛ. WЭ ㅏㄹЭ TㅎЭ UNΣЭЭN. WЭ ㅎㅏUNT TㅎЭ ΣㅎㅏΔΩWЭ. WЭ ΣЭЭ YΩU, ФΩㄹ ΩUㄹ ЭYЭΣ ㅏㄹЭ ㅏΛWㅏYΣ ΩΠЭN. WЭ ㅈUΔΓЭ YΩU ФΩㄹ YΩU ㅎㅏVЭ ФㅏИΛЭΔ TㅎЭ WΩㄹΛΔ. YΩU ㅋNΩW UΣ БUT YΩU WИΛΛ NΩT ΣЭЭ UΣ UNTИΛ ИT ИΣ TΩΩ ΛㅏTЭ.</blockquote>
            <p>That is indeed a long message and with that here is the final message.
            <br><br>
            “<b>The forgotten, the lost, the forsaken, the vengeful. We are the unseen. We haunt the shadowe. We see you, for our eyes are always open. We judge you for you have failed the world. You know us but you will not see us until it is too late.</b>”<br><br>
                
            And on that note, it ended. The unseen twitter sent out these messages.</p>

            <p>“<b>The message has been discovered. Spread it like an illness. Let the world know.</b>"<br><br>

                “<b>Yes, call it out into the darkness. Tell them all. Let them see.</b>"<br><br>
                
                And finally, the last one.<br><br>
                
                “<b>You have served us well. Our gifts await you all.</b>”</p>
