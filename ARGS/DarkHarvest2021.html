            <h2>The Return</h2>
            <p>On the 30th of September we got a alert. The Unseen has started to move again. <a href="https://twitter.com/dntls_TheUnseen/status/1443352038599843843">Their twitter</a> became active and they send a tweet. 
            Their first message since last Dark Harvest. With a picture attached to it.</p>

            <img src="../ARGS/clues/2021/Tweet-30092021Attach.png" width="50%">
            <p>They posted a cipher too which reads:</p>
            <blockquote>WЭ­ ­ ­­ ­ ­ㅏㄹЭ­ ­ ­­ ­ ­ㅎЭㄹЭ;­ ­ ­­ ­ ­WЭ­ ­ ­­ ­ ­ㅏㄹЭ­ ­ ­­ ­ ­ΣTㄹΩNΓ.­ ­ ­­ ­ ­ΔㄹㅏW­ ­ ­­ ­ ­CΛΩΣЭ­ ­ ­­ ­ ­TΩ­ ­ ­­ ­ ­TㅎЭ­ ­ ­­ ­ ­ㅋNΩWΛЭΔΓЭ­ ­ ­­ ­ ­ㅋЭЭΠЭㄹ’Σ­ ­ ­­ ­ ­ㅏБΩΔЭ.­ ­ ­­ ­ ­ΩUㄹ­ ­ ­­ ­ ­ИNΣИΓNИㅏ­ ­ ­­ ­ ­ΓUИΔЭΣ­ ­ ­­ ­ ­TㅎЭ­ ­ ­­ ­ ­WㅏY.</blockquote>
            <p>When translated this says: <b>We­ ­are­ ­here;  We ­are­ ­strong.­ Draw­ ­close­ ­to ­the ­knowledge­ keeper’s­ ­abode.­ Our­ insignia­ guides­ the­ ­way.</b><br>
            This message signifies the return once again of the Unseen Cult. They are once again back trying to recruit people to help with their goal of 
            reaching the doomsday and they want you to know that you have to follow their symbols so reach the truth.</p>

            <h2>Boxes of Truth</h2>
            <h3 id="Box1">Box 1</h3>
            <p>The day after on the 1st of October we got another message from the twitter account.</p>
            <img src="../ARGS/clues/2021/Tweet-01102021.png" width="50%">
            <img src="../ARGS/clues/2021/Tweet-01102021Attach.png" width="50%">
            <p>They posted a cipher too which reads:</p>
            <blockquote>TㅎΩΣЭ­ ­ ­­ ­ ­WㅎΩ­ ­ ­­ ­ ­ΣЭЭㅋ­ ­ ­­ ­ ­UΣ­ ­ ­­ ­ ­ΩUT­ ­ ­­ ­ ­WИΛΛ­ ­ ­­ ­ ­БЭ­ ­ ­­ ­ ­ㄹЭWㅏㄹΔЭΔ­ ­ ­­ ­ ­WИTㅎ­ ­ ­­ ­ ­TㅎЭ­ ­ ­­ ­ ­ЭYЭ­ ­ ­­ ­ ­TㅎㅏT­ ­ ­­ ­ ­ΣЭЭΣ­ ­ ­­ ­ ­ИNTΩ­ ­ ­­ ­ ­TㅎЭ­ ­ ­­ ­ ­VΩИΔ.</blockquote>
            <p>When translated this says: <b>Those­ ­who­ ­seek us­ out will ­be­ ­rewarded­ with­ ­the­ ­eye­ ­that­ sees ­into­ ­the ­void.</b><br>
            They are now saying that we will be rewarded with the ability to see into the void for those who seek them out. If you look at the picture you can find the location of the 
            box. It looks like the Vault and Hunt Pass area. When you check that location you can find the box.</p>
            <img src="../ARGS/clues/2021/LocationOfBox1.png" width="50%">
            <p>And if you go up to it, it will allow you to pick it up and it will then show you this message.</p>
            <img src="../ARGS/clues/2021/Location1Lore.png" width="50%">
            <p>They have called all the dormat cultist. They want them to prepare for the upcoming Dark Harvest. This so called "Ebony Beast" could be refering to the 
                Riftstalker which they summon during the first Dark Harvest or it could be refering to the Shrowd. Since they have been known to make Shrowd effigies in
                the past. They could also be refering to a new behemoth that we have not seen before. Only time will tell.
            </p>

            <h3 id="Box2">Box 2</h3>
            <p>The day after we get another tweet.</p>
            <img src="../ARGS/clues/2021/Tweet-02102021.png" width="50%">

            <p>When we translate this, it says: <b>Where the ­water­ meets ­the­ ground­ ­…­ another­ ­eye­ awaits­ you.</b><br>
            This is telling us where to find the second box. Whihc can be found where water meets the ground. This could be talking about the different areas around
            Ramsgate where there are water running. But it is not a waterfall, but rather a little pipe running water. Besides the Ramsgate entrance and close to the Event
            guy.</p>
            <img src="../ARGS/clues/2021/LocationOfBox2.png" width="50%">
            <img src="../ARGS/clues/2021/Location2Lore.png" width="50%">
            <p>The isles are slowly drifting into their places. The "long night" is refering to the Dark Harvest and it is upon Ramsgate soon. They also want us to know that they are still here.
                Also after collecting these two boxes it led to a Rumor.</p>

        <section id="Rumor">
            <h2>Rumor</h2>
            <p>After looking around we found the notes posted by the Unseen. It was found behind Dr. Shaed Priyani house.</p>

            <p>This note would give this quest.</p>
