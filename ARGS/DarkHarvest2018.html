                <h3>Phenomenon</h3>
            <p> The Dark Harvest returned to Ramsgate in October of 2018. The first time we got information about the Unseen was in the news on the <a href="https://playdauntless.com/news/">Official Dauntless News page</a> on the 5 of October. In this news page, we also get to see some graffiti<sup><a href="https://playdauntless.com/news/dark-harvest-2018/" title="The Dark Harvest Returns">1</a></sup>, which was the first cipher.</p>
            <p>Then it happened in the patch number <a href="https://playdauntless.com/patch-notes/ob-0-5-9/">0.5.9</a>  was where we got the same cipher again.</p>

                <blockquote>ΔΩ­ ­ ­­ ­ ­YΩU­ ­ ­­ ­ ­CㅏㄹㄹY­ ­ ­­ ­ ­ㅏ­ ­ ­­ ­ ­ΛㅏNTЭㄹN?</blockquote>

            <p>When you translate this you get "<b>Do you carry a Lantern?</b>". Later on October 23, there was an update with another cipher.</p>


                <blockquote>𑀛ΩИ𑀦 UΣ</blockquote>
            <p>Which when translated means "<b>Join us</b>"</p>

                <h3>The Cult arrives in Ramsgate</h3>

            <p>Strange marking starts appearing in Ramsgate. As seen in this picture, someone started spraypainting some strange markings.<br>
            Inside the city of Ramsgate, strange markings are not all just graffiti. Some of them seem like ciphers and the first cipher that slayers found was the "<i>Sewer Cipher</i>"<br>
            This cipher was found by going near the sewers and inside you would find this.</p>

            <img title="Found in the Sewers of Ramsgate" src="../assets\clues\2018\Unseen_Sewercipher_2018.png">

            <p>This here reads:</p>
                <blockquote>ΣЭЭN ㅏNΔ WㅏИTИNΓ ИN ΔㅏㄹꟻNЭΣΣ</blockquote>

            <p>When you translate that you will get the message: <b>"Unseen and waiting in darkness"</b><br>
            This next cipher was found after going further after finding the first, you will find this next cipher.</p>

            <img title="Found after you exit the sewers" src="../assets\clues\2018\Unseen_after_the_sewercipher_2018.png">

            <p>This message here reads: </p>
                <blockquote>TㅎЭ ΣㅎㅏTTЭㄹЭΔ ㅁUΣT ФㅏΛΛ</blockquote>

            <p>When you decipher this, you will get the message: "<i>The Shattered must fall</i>". The Shattered that the message is referring to is the The Shattered Isles. Since the Unseen is classified as a doomsday cult, it makes sense that they would try to eliminate the city of Ramsgate as well as the Islands that make up the surrounding area.</p>


            <p>This last cipher was the "<i>Cave Cipher</i>" and was found inside the cave behind the waterfall.</p>

            <img title="Found inside the cave under the waterfall" src="../assets\clues\2018\Unseen_in_cavecipher_2018.png">

            <p>This cipher was the last one inside Ramsgate. When you entered the cave behind the waterfall, you would find the effigy of a Shrowd.</p>
            <img src="../assets\clues\2018\ShrowdEffigy.png" title="Credit to u/unzariurufu">


            <p>And if you looked up you would find this cipher:</p>
                <blockquote>ΣЭЭ TㅎЭ ΣΩUNΔ ㅏNΔ ꟻИΩW TㅎЭ UNΣЭЭN</blockquote>

            <p>When translated you will get the message: "<b>See the sound and kiow the Unseen</b>". If you listened to the sounds in the cave, you would hear that it was not the normal Ramsgate music.</p>

            <p>When you run this message through an audio software that has the ability to create a Spectrogram<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrogram" title="What is a Spectrogram?">2</a></sup>. You would find a message hidden in the audio. As you see here:</p>

            <img src="../assets\clues\2018\Spectrogram_Unseen_Cave.png" alt="Unseen Cave">

            <p>This Spectrogram reads:</p> 
                <blockquote>@ΔNTΛΣ_TㅎЭUNΣЭЭN ㅏㄹЭ ΛИΣTЭNИNΓ. ΣΠЭㅏㅋ TㅎЭ WΩㄹΔΣ: ФㅏΛΛЭN ΣㅎㅏΔΩW</blockquote>

            <p>When you decipher this you get the message: "<b><a href="https://twitter.com/dntls_theunseen">@dntls_TheUnseen</a> are listening. Speak the words: Fallen Shadow</b>" This was the official account for the Unseen and if you spoke the words "Fallen Shadow" you would be rewarded with the Unseen Armour, Unseen Flare and Unseen Sigil.
            This was the end of the ARG.  The Unseen seemed to escape into the shadow until they return again...</p>
