                <h2>The Begining (Patch Notes)</h2>
                <p>On the 20th of October, we recieved the first cipher of 2020. It came on the <a href="https://playdauntless.com/patch-notes/1-4-3/">Patch Notes for the 1.4.3. </a>
                It came with the message: </p>
                <img src="../ARGS\clues\2020\DarkHarvestBeginning2020.png" width="750px">
                <p class="quote">This year, Dark Harvest begins on October 26 — and there’s more to enjoy than ever before. Brush up on your Unseen glyphs and keep an eye on your inbox. We’re keeping the event shrouded in mystery for now, but details are coming soon!</p>
                <p>Beside this we also got a Unseen Cipher</p>
                <blockquote>ΣЭЭ­ YΩU­ ­ИN ­TㅎЭ­ ­TㅎЭ ­ΣΠㅏCЭ ­БЭTWЭЭN­ ­ㄹЭㅏΛㅁΣ, ­ΣΛㅏYЭㄹΣ.</blockquote>
                <p>When you translate this you get will get this message: <b>See­ you­ ­in ­the­ ­the ­space ­between­ ­realms, ­slayers.</b><br>
                What the Unseen could be refereing to could be the Umbral Void. Which we have seen that Riftstalker most likely live in aswell as Thrax.</p>

            <section id="EventPortal">
                <h2>Event Portals</h2>
                <p>On the 23th of October, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi_Le4ARsA1cajIsHDvFV7g">DauntlessLion</a> posted a video, it was about the Dark Harvest for this year and it contained a lot of new cosmetics and events things.</p>
            
                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XJATMuP9a7o" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

                <p>During a section of the video Lion encounteres a portal</p>
                <img src="../ARGS\clues\2020\Unseen Portal.png" alt="From Lions Video" width=400px;>

                <p>This portal when interacted with, transports the user into a sorta mirror dimension where you can collect these tokens called "Harvest Coins" which Lion shows that you can exchange for cosmetics only available during the Dark Harvest</p>

            <section id="Effigy">
                <h2>Shrowd Effigy</h2>
                <p>Also in this video there was shown a statue that could be found in the hunt areas. Some of you may remember that the same statue was seen in old Ramsgate during the last Unseen Event.</p>
                <img src="../ARGS\clues\2018\ShrowdEffigy.png" title="Credit to u/unzariurufu"><br>
                <img src="../ARGS\clues\2020\Shrowd Effigy.png"  alt="From CyberMessiahs Video" width=500px;>
                <p>In these videos we are able to see that these statues can be damaged and when they are destroyed they will either spawn a Shrowd Shadow (Clone) or it will spawn a Shrowd Orb. These statues seems to be randomly generated and the effect might be too.</p>

                <p>He also showed of three ciphers which was contained in a lore pieces. The first Cipher goes as follows:</p>
                    <blockquote>ㅏㄹㄹΩΓㅏNT   VЭΣΣЭΛ   БㄹΩUΓㅎT   ΛΩW   ФИNㅏΛ   ΠΩㄹT   ΩФ   CㅏΛΛ,   TㅎЭ   VΩИΔ   ΔㄹY     ΣㅋY,     ΔㄹYЭㄹ,     ЭㅏㄹTㅎ, БㄹΩㅋЭN   WИNΓΣ   ΓㄹΩUNΔЭΔ</blockquote>
                <p>When you translate this you get will get this message: <b>Arrogant vessel brought low final port of call, the void dry sky, dryer, earth, broken wings grounded.</b><br>
                The word dry seems to be here a lot which could refere to the desert area. Though it doesn't leave us much of a hint.</p>
                
                <h3 id="Unsettling">Unsettling Cipher</h3>
                <img src="../ARGS\clues\2020\Unsettling Cipher.png" alt="From Lions Video" width=500px;>
                <p>The second cipher goes as follows: </p>
                    <blockquote>ㅋNИVЭΣ   ΩФ   ИCЭ,   БΛㅏΔЭΣ   ΩФ   CΩΛΔ   ΔㅏΓΓЭㄹΣ   ФㄹΩЗЭN   ИN   TㅎЭ   ㅏCT   ΣTΩㄹㅁΣ   CㅏNNΩT   ΣЭㅏΛ   TㅎЭ   VΩИΔ   ΠㅏㄹㅏΔΩX</blockquote>
                <p>When you translate this you get will get this message: <b>Knives of ice, blades of cold daggers frozen in the act storms cannot seal the void paradox</b><br>
                This could refere to the ice area in Dauntless, since the words "ice", "cold", and "frozen" all appear in the text.</p>
                
                <h3 id="Mysterious">Mysterious Cipher</h3>
                <img src="../ARGS\clues\2020\Mysterious Cipher.png" alt="From Lions Video" width=500px;>
                <p>The third and final cipher goes as follows: </p>
                    <blockquote>ΔΩΩㅁЭΔ   ㅏNΔ   ΣЭVЭㄹЭΔ,   YЭT   ИΣ   ΣTㅏNΔΣ   ㅏΛΛ   TㅎㅏT   ㄹЭㅁㅏИNΣ,   ㄹΩTTИNΓ   ㅏNΔ   ㅎΩΛΛΩW   TㅎЭ   VΩИΔ   ΣЭЭㅋΣ   TㄹㅏΓЭΔY   ㄹЭㅁNㅏNT</blockquote>
                <p>When you translate this you get will get this message: <b>Doomed and severed, yet is stands all that remains, rotting and hollow the void seeks tragedy remnant</b><br>
                This one does seem to refere to something that was destroyed and it not used anymore. It could be refereing to the old Ramsgate which was destroyed and abandond.</p>

                <p>Later the same day we got the <a href="https://playdauntless.com/news/dark-harvest-2020/">official post</a> about the Dark Harvest. Which came with some clues to the ciphers that was found in the lore pieces. <br>
                And I quote: </p><p class="quote">Each day from October 26 to October 30, you can <b>track down a new Unseen lore node</b> in Ramsgate that’ll offer clues leading to the location of their portals.</p>
                <p>What was also said is that the Shrowd Effigies can drop certain items, but <i>they also have a chance to conjure something far more lethal</i></p>
