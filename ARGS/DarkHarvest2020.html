                <h2>The Begining (Patch Notes)</h2>
                <p>On the 20th of October, we recieved the first cipher of 2020. It came on the <a href="https://playdauntless.com/patch-notes/1-4-3/">Patch Notes for the 1.4.3. </a>
                It came with the message: </p>

                <p class="quote">This year, Dark Harvest begins on October 26 — and there’s more to enjoy than ever before. Brush up on your Unseen glyphs and keep an eye on your inbox. We’re keeping the event shrouded in mystery for now, but details are coming soon!</p>
                <p>Beside this we also got a Unseen Cipher</p>

                What the Unseen could be refereing to could be the Umbral Void. Which we have seen that Riftstalker most likely live in aswell as Thrax.</p>

                <h2>Event Portals</h2>
                <p>On the 23th of October, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi_Le4ARsA1cajIsHDvFV7g">DauntlessLion</a> posted a video, it was about the Dark Harvest for this year and it contained a lot of new cosmetics and events things.</p>

                <p>During a section of the video Lion encounteres a portal</p>
                <img src="../ARGS\clues\2020\Unseen Portal.png" alt="From Lions Video" width=400px;>

                <p>This portal when interacted with, transports the user into a sorta mirror dimension where you can collect these tokens called "Harvest Coins" which Lion shows that you can exchange for cosmetics only available during the Dark Harvest</p>

            <section id="Effigy">
                <h2>Shrowd Effigy</h2>
                <p>Also in this video there was shown a statue that could be found in the hunt areas. Some of you may remember that the same statue was seen in old Ramsgate during the last Unseen Event.</p>

                <p>In these videos we are able to see that these statues can be damaged and when they are destroyed they will either spawn a Shrowd Shadow (Clone) or it will spawn a Shrowd Orb. These statues seems to be randomly generated and the effect might be too.</p>

                <p>He also showed of three ciphers which was contained in a lore pieces. The first Cipher goes as follows:</p>

                <p>When you translate this you get will get this message: <b>Arrogant vessel brought low final port of call, the void dry sky, dryer, earth, broken wings grounded.</b><br>
                The word dry seems to be here a lot which could refere to the desert area. Though it doesn't leave us much of a hint.</p>
                
                <h3 id="Unsettling">Unsettling Cipher</h3>
                <img src="../ARGS\clues\2020\Unsettling Cipher.png" alt="From Lions Video" width=500px;>
                <p>The second cipher goes as follows: </p>
                    <blockquote>ㅋNИVЭΣ   ΩФ   ИCЭ,   БΛㅏΔЭΣ   ΩФ   CΩΛΔ   ΔㅏΓΓЭㄹΣ   ФㄹΩЗЭN   ИN   TㅎЭ   ㅏCT   ΣTΩㄹㅁΣ   CㅏNNΩT   ΣЭㅏΛ   TㅎЭ   VΩИΔ   ΠㅏㄹㅏΔΩX</blockquote>
                <p>When you translate this you get will get this message: <b>Knives of ice, blades of cold daggers frozen in the act storms cannot seal the void paradox</b><br>
                This could refere to the ice area in Dauntless, since the words "ice", "cold", and "frozen" all appear in the text.</p>
                
                <h3 id="Mysterious">Mysterious Cipher</h3>
                <img src="../ARGS\clues\2020\Mysterious Cipher.png" alt="From Lions Video" width=500px;>
                <p>The third and final cipher goes as follows: </p>
                    <blockquote>ΔΩΩㅁЭΔ   ㅏNΔ   ΣЭVЭㄹЭΔ,   YЭT   ИΣ   ΣTㅏNΔΣ   ㅏΛΛ   TㅎㅏT   ㄹЭㅁㅏИNΣ,   ㄹΩTTИNΓ   ㅏNΔ   ㅎΩΛΛΩW   TㅎЭ   VΩИΔ   ΣЭЭㅋΣ   TㄹㅏΓЭΔY   ㄹЭㅁNㅏNT</blockquote>
                <p>When you translate this you get will get this message: <b>Doomed and severed, yet is stands all that remains, rotting and hollow the void seeks tragedy remnant</b><br>
                This one does seem to refere to something that was destroyed and it not used anymore. It could be refereing to the old Ramsgate which was destroyed and abandond.</p>

                <p>What was also said is that the Shrowd Effigies can drop certain items, but <i>they also have a chance to conjure something far more lethal</i></p>

                <p>The feeling when I saw this message. It made me so happy. This first message had an interesting cipher.</p>

                <p>What they might be refering to is that fact that we are drawing closer and closer to the Dark Harvest, but it also seems like there is more to the Dark Harvest then just the ciphers that we have gotten already.</p>

                <p>This here reads: <b>Stop the ritual</b>. This was also deciphered by Phoenix Labs themselves in the video. They might be hinting towards a new event in the coming future.</p>
                
                <p>This day also gave us a new tweet from the Unseen Twitter account</p>

                <p>It was also here where the first cipher lore piece was released. And as the theory we had held true. This cipher was the "Disturbing". It lead to the position of the first portals, located inside of the <i>Iron falls</i> and <i>Revelation Rock</i></p>

                <h2>The Second Day of the Dark Harvest</h2>
                <p>On the second day of the Dark Harvest we got the "Mysterious" cipher which if our theory is true this one should be on the <i>Aulric's Refuge/Dyadic Drift</i> maps.</p>

                <p>The reason for it being here is because the cipher says "Doomed and severed" refering to the tree that once stood there, it is now "rotting" as the cipher is saying and therefore the portal is here.</p>

                <p>Along with this clue, the Unseen twitter account sent out a pair of ciphers.</p>

                In this message the Unseen are clearly telling us, the slayers, that we are not welcome in their ritual and that we are defiling the portals which otherwise are only for the Unseen cult to see.
                They want us to stop entering the portals. And to stop us from invading their realm, they have opened more to "avoid the greed of the unanointed."</p>

                <p>When translated this says: <b>The ­slayers ­continue ­to ­be ­a­ ­nuisance. ­We ­have ­­opened ­­a ­new ­­location ­to ­­avoid ­­their ­prying ­eyes.</b></p>
                <p>They keep saying that we are being annoying and interrupting their ritual. So far we are doing great at ruining their ritual. So keep up the good work.</p>

                <p>Today the "Uncanny" cipher was the one revealed to us. So the position seems to be two places again. These seem to be on the Sovereign's Throne and the Underwald map.</p>

                <p>When translated it will give you this: <b>Their ­dishonor ­knows ­no ­bounds! ­We ­have ­torn ­­open ­another ­­entrance ­in ­the ­­weave.</b><br>
                Once again they have opened a portal for us to find. The portal this time seems to the "Unsettling Cipher"</p>

                They are here refering to the "Unseen Summons" event, they admit that we have been stopping them from completing the ritual. Meaning we are doing great.</p>
